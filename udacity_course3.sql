### NULLS
-- Defintion: NULLS are not zero; they are cells where data does not exist.
-- When identifying NULLS in a WHERE clause, we write IS NULL or IS NOT NULL. (We don't use = because NULL is not a value in SQL)
-- NULLS often occur when performing a LEFT OR RIGHT JOIN as we saw in previous lessons when certain rows in the left table of a left join 
-- are not matched with rows in the right table; NULLS can also occur from simply missing data in our database.
